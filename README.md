#### This package doesn't support 0.3

#### Packages that use FixedSizeArrays:
[GeometryTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryTypes.jl)

#### Usage and advantages:
FixedSizeArrays is giving any composite type array like behavior by inheriting from FixedSizeArrays.
So you can do something like this:
```Julia
immutable RGB{T} <: FixedVectorNoTuple{3, T}
    r::T
    g::T
    b::T
    function RGB(a::NTuple{3, T}) #needs to be like this to keep constructor code sane
        new{T}(a[1], a[2], a[3])
    end
end
immutable Vec{N, T} <: FixedVector{N, T} # defined in FixedSizeArrays already
    _::NTuple{N, T}
end
Vec{3, Float32}(77) # constructor with 1 argument already defined
rand(Vec{3, Float64})+sin(Vec(0.,2.,2.)) # a lot of array functions are already defined
#There is also a matrix type
eye(Mat{3,3,Float32}) * rand(Vec{3, Float32}) # will also "just work"
a = Vec(1,2,3)[1:2] # returns (1,2)
```
Note that all of the above types are stack allocated and the speed of operations should be fairly fast!
If you find operations to be slow, please file a bug report!

FixedSizeArrays can be used in a lot of different ways.
You can define color types the same way, and arbitrary other point types like normals, vertices etc.
As they all inherit from FixedSizeArray, it's very easy to handle them in the same way.

For some more advantages, you can take a look at [MeshIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/MeshIO.jl).

Because it's so easy to define different types like Point3, RGB, HSV or Normal3, one can create customized code for these types via multiple dispatch. This is great for visualizing data, as you can offer default visualizations based on the type.
Without FixedSizeArrays, this would end up in a lot of types which would all need to define the same functions over and over again.

#### FixedArray abstract types

The package provides several abstract types:

  * `FixedArray{T,NDim,SIZE}` is the abstract base type for all fixed
    arrays.  `T` and `NDim` mirror the eltype and number of dimension type
    parameters in `AbstractArray`.  In addition there's a `SIZE` Tuple which
    defines the extent of each fixed dimension as an integer.

There's some convenient type aliases:

  * `FixedVector{N,T}` is a convenient type alias for a one dimensional fixed
    vector of length `N` and eltype `T`.
  * `FixedMatrix{N,M,T}` is a convenient type alias for a two dimensional fixed
    matrix of size `(N,M)` and eltype `T`.

Finally there's an abstract type `FixedVectorNoTuple{N, T}` for use when you'd
like to name the fields of a `FixedVector` explicitly rather than accessing them
via an index.


#### FixedArray concrete types

The package currently provides three concrete FixedArray types

  * `Vec{N,T}` is a length `N` vector of eltype `T`.
  * `Mat{N,M,T}` is an `NÃ—M` matrix of eltype `T`

These two types are intended to behave the same as `Base.Vector` and
`Base.Matrix`, but with fixed size.  That is, the interface is a convenient
union of elementwise array-like functionality and vector space / linear algebra
operations.  Hopefully we'll have more general higher dimensional fixed size
containers in the future (note that the total number of elements of a higher
dimensional container quickly grows beyond the size where having a fixed stack
allocated container really makes sense).

  * `Point{N,T}` is a position type which is structurally identical to `Vec{N,T}`.

Semantically `Point{N,T}` should be used to represent position in an
`N`-dimensional Cartesian space.  The distinction between this and `Vec` is
particularly relevant when overloading functions which deal with geometric data.
For instance, a geometric transformation applies differently depending on
whether you're transforming a *position* (`Point`) versus a *direction* (`Vec`).


#### User-supplied functions for FixedArray subtypes

Most array functionality comes for free when inheriting from one of the abstract
types `FixedArray`, `FixedVector`, `FixedMatrix`, or `FixedVectorNoTuple`.
However, the user may want to overload a few things.  At the moment,
`similar_type` is the main function you may want to customize.  The signature is

```julia
similar_type{FSA<:FixedArray, T, NDim}(::Type{FSA}, ::Type{T}, sz::NTuple{NDim,Int})
```

This is quite similar to `Base.similar` but the first argument is a type rather
than a value.  Given a custom FixedArray type, eltype and size, this function
should return a similar output type which will be used to store the results of a
elementwise operations, general `map()` invocation, etc.

By default, `similar_type` returns the input type `FSA` if both `eltype(FSA) == T`
and `size(FSA) == sz`.  If not, the canonical concrete FixedArray type (a `Vec`
or `Mat`) are returned.  If your custom FixedArray subtype is parameterized on
size or eltype this may not be the right thing.

For example, suppose you define the type `RGB{T}` as above.  This inherently has
a fixed size but variable eltype.  Perhaps you want mixed operations with
`RGB{Int}` and `RGB{Float64}` to return an `RGB{Float64}`.  In this case you
should write something like:

```julia
function FixedSizeArrrays.similar_type{FSA<:RGB,T}(::Type{FSA}, ::Type{T}, n::Tuple{Int})
    n[1] == 3 ? RGB{T} : similar_type(FixedArray, T, n)
end
```

We then have `RGB(1,2,3) + RGB(1.0,1.0,1.0) === RGB(2.0,3.0,4.0)`, but also more
exotic things, such as `RGB(1,2,3) + RGB(1.0im,1.0im,1.0im) === RGB(1.0 +
1.0im,2.0 + 1.0im,3.0 + 1.0im)`.  More usefully, this all works with types such
as `Dual{T}` from DualNumbers which allows derivative information to be
naturally propagated in FixedArray elements.

Note that `similar_type` as written above isn't type stable.  For the internal
use in `FixedSizeArrays` (type deduction inside `@generated` functions) this
isn't a problem, but you may want to annotate it with `Base.@pure` if you're
using julia-0.5 and you want to use `similar_type` in a normal function.
